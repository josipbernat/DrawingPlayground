# DrawingPlayground
A simple demonstration of using Swift Playground to draw different shapes with CoreGraphics. This is based on WWDS 2015 "Building Better Apps with Value Types in Swift" lesson with my addition of CG drawing code.

## In short
I've written this example to test knowledge I've learned in WWDC 2015 Swift sessions. They were favoring valye types over classes which I never used in this way before. Keynote speaker also menitoned that Swift is world's first Protocol Oriented Language so I wanted to dive into this excersise and give it a try.

## Future updates
This sample code is written using Swift 2.0 and it should be run using Xcode 7.0. For future I would like to add simple animations using CADisplayLink (if available in Playground).

Feel free to fork it and modify.
